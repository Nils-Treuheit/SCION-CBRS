# SCION-CDN
Create a Benchmark to measure the impact of different communication paths on the content delivery of small SCION network using 2 ASes with several paths and hops between them. 
Content Files are purpose-oriented deviations of cited sources to benchmark different content network traffic. Content files will not be uploaded to the repository and might only be temporarily available under the sourced links as I do not plan to regular update them and have to refrain from redistributing content of other creators on the web. The website text is partially generated with ChatGPT and not fact checked as I just needed a larger chunk of text to download.
