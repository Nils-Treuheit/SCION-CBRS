# SCION-CDN
Create a Benchmark to measure the impact of different communication paths on the content delivery of an emulated SCION network using the SEED-Emulator 
Content Files are purpose-oriented deviations of cited sources to benchmark different content network traffic in the SEED-Emulation. Content files will only be temporarily available to transport them between devices and will be replaced by links very soon as they should not be redistributed on the web.
